Let’s take a look at some of the claims that have been made about eating breakfast and then we’ll talk about the other side of the big breakfast debate. Plus, I’ll even give you the scoop on my own personal experiment with skipping breakfast. A Few Claims in Favor of Eating Breakfast: 1. Breakfast Eaters Have Healthier Habits Current “official” nutrition guidelines suggest that breakfast helps with weight loss and that skipping breakfast has often been associated with obesity. While observational studies indicate that breakfast eaters tend to be leaner and healthier than non-breakfast eaters, there is no evidence of a direct causal relationship between eating breakfast and these outcomes. It’s quite possible that people who tend to eat breakfast are healthier due to other healthy habits , such as exercising regularly and/or refraining from both smoking and excessive alcohol intake. 2. Breakfast Helps to Rev Your Metabolism There’s been a lot of talk about the metabolism boosting benefits associated with eating breakfast. The idea behind this is based on the fact that when we eat we burn energy, and therefore calories, during the process of digestion. So, after fasting overnight, that first meal of the day jump starts your metabolism. However, studies show that there really is no difference in calories burned over 24 hours between breakfast eaters and breakfast skippers. The takeaway here is that whether you eat or skip, there’s no significant difference in calories burned from one day to the next. 3. Skipping Breakfast Causes Weight Gain This sounds like a reasonable claim based on the notion that if you skip breakfast you may end up overly hungry, which results in overeating later in the day. Once again, this claim is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, there are studies that show that skipping breakfast could result in an overall caloric deficit of up to 400 calories per day. While skipping breakfast might make you eat more at lunch, studies show that it’s not enough to overcompensate for the calories skipped at breakfast. Can Skipping Breakfast Incur Health Benefits? Let’s take a look from a different perspective. You may have heard of a term called “intermittent fasting,” which has become a very popular trend in the last few years. While there are several approaches to an intermittent fast, the general rule of thumb is a 16/8 hour rule, which means a 16 hour overnight fast, followed by an 8 hour window of eating. The time frame in which you fast and eat can vary from person to person. For example, it’s suggested that women find a 14/10 rule to be more reasonable so as not to compromise hormonal balance. Typically, the eating “window” runs from lunch until dinner, therefore automatically omitting the breakfast meal. Oftentimes this looks like an eating window of 12 pm – 8 pm, give or take. You would expect that consuming calories in a smaller range of time would naturally reduce overall caloric intake, and research supports that it actually does, leading to weight loss and improved health. However, this may not be the case for everyone. Intermittent fasting can affect men and women differently, and it seems that women may not benefit from it as much as men. Specifically, menstrual cycles can be vulnerable to disruption, especially if calories are significantly reduced, which can offset hormonal balance and communication between the brain and reproductive organs. The aftermath could translate to irregular periods, infertility and compromised bone health. For this reason, it’s recommended that women who desire to Intermittent Fast should adhere to a shorter fasting window using the 14/10 rule. Some of the proposed benefits of Intermittent Fasting include lower blood pressure, improved cardiovascular health, improved management and or/prevention of diabetes, reduced inflammation, preserved muscle mass and of course weight loss, but more research on human subjects is needed to back these claims. My Personal Experiment with Intermittent Fasting: I’ll admit- I’ve been a bit wary, BUT also very curious about how intermittent fasting would fit into my own routine, so I decided to give it a try. I’m only 12 days in as I’m writing this, but I feel like it’s been a long enough run to at least shed some light on my initial observations. My concerns before taking the plunge: I exercise daily, mostly in the morning, and I was worried that exercising on an empty stomach would leave me with sub-optimal energy, possibly to the point of passing out, since my workouts are fairly intense. I used to always work out on an empty stomach, but more recently I tend to eat a light breakfast beforehand. I often share breakfast with my husband as we get the kids off to school. We take turns frying eggs, making avocado toast, or having breakfast sandwiches and sharing bites. Rarely do we sit down to enjoy it, but surely I would be highly annoyed about having to decline bites, all the while making school lunches for our kids. The constraints of a compressed eating window seemed a little rigid and inconvenient in the midst of juggling a busy evening schedule with kids’ sports, school concerts, and the like. As much as I would like to embrace an earlier dinner, this is not always the reality for my family. I find value in family dinner whenever possible, even if it’s at 9 pm. The same thing goes for date night with my husband, when we tend to eat on the later side after our youngest is in bed. Here’s What Happened (predominantly using the 14/10 rule): It’s easier than I expected. While I do wake up hungry, my morning coffee (which is allowed as long as it’s black) and water quickly offset my hunger and get me through the initial hours. Ghrelin, the hunger hormone that stimulates appetite, is typically released during your normal eating hours, so you do feel hungry, but then it passes even if you don’t eat. It’s OK to feel hungry! I have been able to work out without any problems and my running time actually improved. Perhaps I was chasing down that meal on the other side, but I was pleasantly surprised that I could make it through the same intense workouts without a problem. Given the hard line in the sand with the eating window, I stopped nibbling at the lunch I was making for my kids in the morning, or taking mindless bites of the “shared” breakfast between my husband and me. In reality, this was just a convenient way to consume some calories before a workout, which I thought I needed, though it turns out I didn’t. I have been more intentional about what that first meal of the day looks like (around 11 am). I have, however, missed having breakfast on the weekends when we are able to enjoy a more leisurely pace and eat as a family, but this doesn’t happen often so it was bearable. My weight and calorie consumption haven’t changed significantly. While weight loss was not a priority for me, I expected that I would naturally lose some with a more restrictive eating window. I’ve noticed that as soon as my eating window starts, I can easily compensate for those lost breakfast/nibbling calories by starting with a larger meal. By the time 2:00 rolls around, I’ve typically consumed a similar amount of calories as I would have if I had started my day with a light breakfast, post- workout snack and lunch…just in a different way. Since sports were winding down and the school year was coming to a close as I began my experiment with intermittent fasting (and the fact that I used more of a 14/10 rule), it wasn’t that challenging to adhere to a 10 hour eating window. If I knew we’d be out with friends and possibly eating a little later, it was fairly easy to just adjust the window and simply start eating later the next morning. So What’s the Verdict? Will I continue intermittent fasting as a lifestyle choice? Most likely not. I’ve been more of an intuitive eater my entire life, so adhering to a compressed eating window, while not as difficult as I anticipated, has felt a little too aligned with a diet mentality in many ways. Being tied to the clock felt like one more thing I had to manage and that if I let food slip past my lips even a few minutes before my window started, I was doing something wrong. In thinking ahead to summer travel with family and friends, it would be difficult to maintain this approach and I would likely come across as ungracious if I turned down a home cooked breakfast that was offered in a gesture of hospitality. On the other hand, I can see how this approach might be helpful for others, especially those who tend to struggle with intuitive eating or have a late night snacking habit, for example. A more intentional approach to adhering to time frame surely has benefits. The bottom line in the Great Breakfast Debate? What works for some may not work well for others, and there’s no conclusive evidence that supports one side more than the other when looking at breakfast eaters vs. breakfast skippers. Regardless of the timing of what is consumed in a 24 hour period, the top priority should always be on real, nourishing, minimally processed food that will fuel your body and your brain. It’s important to seek out an approach that will be the most effective in relation to your own personal health goals and lifestyle. Thanks for reading, and let me know if I can help you figure out an approach that will work for you!

Katie Mazzia, MS, RDN, CDCES & Kellie Koswick, MS, RDN, CSG October 31, 2024 The age-old adage that breakfast is the most important meal of the day has been ingrained in our culture for decades. But where did this idea come from, and is it truly backed by science? Clinical Dietitian III and Certified Diabetes Care Education Specialist Katie Mazzia, MS, RDN, CDCES and Clinical Nutrition Manager III Kellie Koswick MS, RDN, CSG delve into the history, benefits and modern perspectives on breakfast to uncover the truth. In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, a PR consultant for Beech-Nut, promoted a protein-rich breakfast of bacon and eggs as healthier than a light breakfast. This campaign significantly influenced American eating habits and 70% of bacon is now consumed at breakfast. Today, we know not to eat a daily dose of processed meats, and we’ve learned that a light breakfast might work better for some. Bernays was onto something when he emphasized the importance of protein, but it doesn’t necessarily need to be consumed in the beginning of the day. What we now know is that the key to good health is to maintain a balanced diet of nutrient-dense food throughout the day. If you’re hungry in the morning, satisfy yourself with healthy food. If you’re not a breakfast person, make sure to get the nutrition you need later in the day. Numerous studies have shown that breakfast eaters tend to have better overall diets. They consume more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and less fat compared to those who skip breakfast. Breakfast provides essential nutrients and energy to kickstart the day, which can be particularly beneficial for cognitive function and physical activity. The benefits of eating breakfast include the following: Blood sugar regulation: Eating breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which is vital for cognitive function and overall energy. Increased movement:\\xa0People who eat breakfast tend to be more active in the morning, contributing to better overall health. Heart health:\\xa0Regular breakfast consumption can lead to less weight gain over time, lower cortisol levels and improved cardiometabolic health. Is It Bad to Skip Breakfast? While breakfast has its benefits, skipping it isn’t necessarily detrimental for everyone. It’s important to listen to your body and eat when you’re hungry versus following a diet or rules about eating. However, prolonged fasting can lead to overeating later in the day, driven by hunger hormones like ghrelin. For those who exercise in the early morning, skipping breakfast can result in poor performance and fatigue, so it’s advisable to eat a small snack before working out. What to Eat for Breakfast The quality of your breakfast matters more than simply eating it. Focus on nutrient-rich options like fruits, whole grains, protein and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods and added sugars. Following are some quick and healthy breakfast ideas: Overnight oats: Easy to prepare and nutritious. Mush® is a prepared grocery item in the cold section. Muesli: A versatile option that can be enjoyed hot or cold (ex. Bobs Red Mill®). Kefir yogurt drink: A quick protein boost. Nuts and dried (unsweetened) or fresh fruit: A simple, portable breakfast. Greek yogurt with berries and nuts: Balanced and delicious. Smoothies: Blend fresh or frozen fruit, hemp seeds, water and vegetables for a nutritious start to your day. Whole grain toast with nut butter, sliced apples and cinnamon: A classic, easy choice. Egg and avocado sourdough toast: Nutritious and filling (limit eggs yolks to 3-4 per week). Meal Prep Ideas For those who are pressed for time, meal prepping can be a lifesaver. Make whole grain pancakes and freeze extras, prepare homemade energy bites, or set up overnight oats for a quick grab-and-go breakfast. While breakfast can offer numerous health benefits, it’s not necessarily the most important meal of the day for everyone. The key is to maintain a balanced diet throughout the day. Whether you’re a breakfast enthusiast or prefer to skip it, focus on nutrient-dense foods and balance in your overall diet.

       "  ToolMessage(content=\"The Big Brekky Debate – Pelican Skip to content Pelican Bringing you the scoop since 1930 Campus Affairs Voice Politics Environment Pop Culture Film and Production Economics Science Literature Music Sport Entertainment The Big Brekky Debate Aug 20, 2021 By Charlie Mills Honestly, its winter and it sucks. This cold weather has got me missing brunch and that fundamental human experience – ordering (and later regretting) a big breakfast. Bring me the grease, waiter, I’d like to nap before midday. Find below a definitive ranking of the elements of a big brekky. For the purposes of this ranking, I’ll be going with the classic elements of a big brekky. That means no spices, no complexity, just a good old fashioned regrettable feast. And when I’m talking big brekky, I’m talking BIG. It better be bigger than anything any human could conceivably eat in one sitting, or I want my money back. To all my American friends out there, if you even say the word ‘pancake’ to me, I’m throwing hands. You may disagree, this may ruffle some feathers, and that’s absolutely fine. But just so you know, you’re wrong, and you can’t even claim to be a brunch afficionado. Keep moving, you breakfast poser. 1. Hash Brown The ultimate king of all breakfasts. The perfect union between fries, chips, mashed potato, and any other form factor of potato melded together into one piece of truly orgasmic fried glory. Plus, usually, they give you two hash browns. Oh my – YES. Put tomato sauce on it, or let it shine on its own, I don’t care. Get it in me. VERDICT: 12/10. Can do no wrong – just do not give me a ‘potato rosti’ and call it a hash brown. You know what you’re doing, and you’ve ruined a perfectly good brunch. Again, you’re a breakfast poser. 2. Bacon Bacon is the true star of most breakfast s. To be honest, it was a real toss-up between hash browns and bacon for the top spot, and the only reason I put this into number two is the thiccness debate. If bacon is a thin and crispy dream, oh boy please – let me at it. But the thicker it is, the worse it gets. Yeah, I get it, you’re a cool café and your bacon is unique, but what you’ve given me is a pork chop. VERDICT: 10/10 (on a good day). Crispy bacon takes the cake on any plate, it has a hard time competing with hash browns. Give me over-thicc bacon and you’ll get slammed on yelp. 3. Eggs The true workhorse of any breakfast. Too often, were concerned with the divisions egg gives us – some like fried, some like scrambled. Bougie pretenders even like poached. But, at the end of the day, we all love eggs. To me, eggs are the great unifier. Give me fried, but any egg is fine. VERDICT: 9/10. Eggs most of the time, are blissful. But every now and then scrambled eggs are the texture of chalk, and that’s disrespectful to eggs. 4. Tomatoes At this point, I know what you’re thinking – this boy hates veggies. But that’s not true. The problem is that the big brekky is not a healthy meal. The addition of tomatoes and mushrooms are a sacrifice really – it’s the cafes way of pretending this isn’t a grease fest intended to cure your pounding hangover. Tomatoes have gotta take the W here though, especially when fried to perfection. VERDICT: 8/10. Tomatoes can be hit and miss, but they are pretty hard to screw up. Fry ‘em up, salt those bad boys, and it’s a refreshing break that staves off the grease coma. 5. Butter Fuck it, my fat intake’s already past critical level. Plastic container of butter, put it on my toast and chuck the sausage on top. Send future me my regards. VERDICT: 7/10. Why did I decide to do this to myself? 6. Sausages A potentially controversial decision here, but I don’t think sausages should be a breakfast food. You’ve already had your bacon (face it, you have no self-control and you’ve gone for the winners first) and suddenly you’re met with the second meat, which, all too often, is thoroughly underwhelming, and somehow fattier than the bacon. VERDICT: 6/10. Why are these sausages always such weird lengths? Be lunch or be nothing. 7. Toast This might look like it’s too low on the list, but toast is a true leader in the breakfast and brunch industries. The only issue is that toast is too often overshadowed by what it holds. Keep your head up queen, we see you and we all love you. VERDICT: 5/10. A true middle of the ground winner. Stay humble, toast. 8. Baked Beans Baked beans are something of a classic, but honestly, I could go without them. I’ve already got tomato on the plate, why do I need it in a worse form? Get your canned shit out of here. Fresh meat and eggs for this breakfast lover. Verdict: 5/10. Are baked beans even baked? What are they? 9. Mushrooms Honestly who let mushrooms be a part of breakfast? I’m no mushroom hater, but during this Dante’s Inferno of a breakfast, I feel like you’re just judging me at this point, mushrooms. Go be soup please. VERDICT: 3/10. This might be cause they’re the last thing on my plate, but they’re grey, they’re mushy, and they’re in my way. Next please. 10. Avocado Yeah, I said it. For too long avocado has been praised by all these bloody breakfast posers, and I’m tired of it. Cancel me if you want, I’ll die on this hill. Take your wet grass and compost it. And why does avocado have to be on EVERYTHING? Ten years ago, I would have never seen these squishy green balls anywhere near my breakfast indulgence, and now they’re touching my eggs. Big nope. VERDICT: -5/10. Fight me.

       "  ToolMessage(content='Best Breakfast Debate – The Warde Focus Skip to content Fairfield Warde High School Newspaper Fairfield Warde High School Newspaper News Features A&E Sports Opinions Blur Archives Home » Opinions » Best Breakfast Debate Best Breakfast Debate October 6, 2023 in Opinions by Charlotte Stack Waking up early enough to arrive on time for period one every morning can be difficult. With this reality for Warde students, finding the time to eat breakfast at all can prove challenging. As for eating a balanced one that keeps you full until lunch? Well that can be even harder. So, I took it upon myself to test out different breakfast options from iced coffee to energy bars and rate how it affected my energy throughout the day. Lemon Luna Bar This energy-esq bar tasted good, and it definitely subsided my morning hunger. But, as the day progressed, I was hungry and tired by second period. Thankfully, I had the first lunch wave, and I was able to eat something else and make myself feel better. This breakfast was easy, as all I had to do was open the package and eat it. Flavor: 8/10 Hunger Erasing Ability: 7/10 Overall Rating: 6/10 Dunkin’ Iced Coffee I do not recommend only having an iced coffee for breakfast. It was terrible. This coffee made me jittery, anxious, and shaky. While drinking coffee in the morning isn’t bad, drinking it without any other food is awful. This wasn’t very easy to do, as I had to make sure I left earlier than normal to make a detour, before coming to school. I’d recommend it as a pick-me- up drink, not a meal. Flavor: 9/10 Hunger Erasing Ability: 3/10 Overall Rating: 4/10 Slice of Pumpkin Bread As a fall favorite of mine, I wanted to make sure to include a seasonal treat on this list, and pumpkin bread was perfect. I made the pumpkin bread the night before, and it was ready for me to enjoy in the morning. While it wasn’t very easy to make the loaf, it was simple to cut a piece and eat it, and if you decide to use a store-bought mix, it’s sure to please. Flavor: 11/10 Hunger Erasing Ability: 8/10 Overall Rating: 10/10 Bowl of Cereal, Fruit, and Yogurt This is definitely the most balanced, and healthiest meal on this list. While it did take me longer to eat and prepare, I would say it’s worth it for the nutritious and filling qualities it provides. This didn’t require any preparation beforehand, but I did have to wake up a bit earlier to be able to sit down and eat my breakfast. The bowl of cereal had grains, and the yogurt gave me protein, ensuring that I would have enough energy for school. Flavor: 9/10 Hunger Erasing Ability: 9/10 Overall Rating: 8/10 No Bake Energy Bites While this was slightly inconvenient to make at the time, the convenience that it brought me in the morning made it worth it. I was able to take more time getting ready, and therefore I was less anxious about getting to school on time. While this breakfast was small in size, it had peanut butter and oats, which gave me enough energy to get through my first two periods. Flavor: 7/10 Hunger Erasing Ability: 8/10 Overall Rating: 7/10 In all, it’s important to eat a healthy, filling breakfast. Even though time is limited early in the morning, what we eat affects almost every aspect of our day. So, please eat breakfast! Leave a comment Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The carb versus fat debate Nutrition by Baylor Scott & White Health Aug\\n31,\\n2022 Eating breakfast in the morning allows your body to “fuel up,” both physically and mentally, increasing energy and concentration levels throughout the day. But given a choice, do you opt for bacon and eggs or something like oatmeal or a bagel with cream cheese? What’s important to consider here is the value of a macronutrient balance. The body receives calories from three types of macronutrients. Carbohydrates Fats Proteins That’s it! The best meals are a balance of these three components. Vitamins, minerals, water and other micronutrients present in food contribute greatly to the body’s health and function; however, they provide no energy source that impacts your weight status. Let’s break down two common breakfast philosophies—high fat and high carb—and get to the bottom of what really makes a healthy breakfast. High fat or high carb? Ideally, meals are balanced between the three macronutrients. Comparing these two breakfast plates is a practice of looking at the extremes, but it’s a helpful illustration when you’re trying to learn more about building a balanced plate. The plate of bacon and eggs contains a significant source of protein but also provides a hefty dose of fats. Contrary to the beliefs of previous low-fat fad diets, dietary fat in food doesn’t directly make you gain body fat. Any of those three macronutrients can create body fat when eaten in excess. On the other side, the bagel with cream cheese provides lots of energy with fast-acting carbs, but also a significant source of the type of carbs that don’t treat our body the best. When we eat refined or white carbohydrates, blood sugar tends to spike, and insulin is released quickly in large amounts. Over time, chronic blood sugar imbalances can lead to insulin resistance, prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Building a better breakfast So, what in the world are you supposed to eat, knowing you want to stay healthy and feed your cells with the energy they need? Breaking apart the meal into components is the easiest. Build a healthy breakfast by incorporating a good source of protein, carbs, fat and the often-missing ingredient, fiber. Protein Greek yogurt or cottage cheese Eggs Smoothie with protein powder Bacon or turkey bacon Sausage or turkey sausage carbs Berries 1/2 banana Apple or orange Oatmeal (no sugar added) Low-sugar granola Whole grain cereal Whole grain toast Fat 1/2 avocado 1-2 tablespoons nut butter or a small handful of nuts Egg yolks Bacon Olive oil, avocado oil or coconut oil Butter or ghee (clarified butter) Coconut (try adding shredded unsweetened coconut to yogurt or oatmeal) The missing ingredient: Fiber We’ve talked about the importance of protein, fat and carbs in every meal, but there’s a little more to it than that. When building your breakfast plate, choosing high-fiber foods will help keep you full for longer. Fiber , the part of plants we don’t digest, does more than regulate the digestive tract. Fiber also: Slows digestion, which keeps blood sugar more stable Lowers cholesterol Regulates blood pressure Promotes weight maintenance Good sources of fiber for breakfast include: Whole wheat bread Oatmeal Vegetables (try making an omelette or scramble) Beans (add black beans to breakfast tacos) Nuts Chia seeds (add a tablespoon to your yogurt bowl) 1/2 avocado Berries Want more healthy eating ideas?

       "  AIMessage(content='The debates surrounding the best breakfast often revolve around several key themes:\\n\\n1. **Importance of Breakfast**: There\\'s a long-standing debate about whether breakfast is truly the most important meal of the day. Some argue that it kickstarts metabolism and provides essential nutrients for the day, while others suggest that skipping breakfast might not be detrimental and could even be beneficial for some individuals, particularly those practicing intermittent fasting.\\n\\n2. **Nutritional Content**: The debate extends to what constitutes a healthy breakfast. Some advocate for a high-protein breakfast, such as eggs and bacon, while others suggest a high-carb breakfast like oatmeal or whole-grain toast. The balance of macronutrients—carbohydrates, fats, and proteins—is often discussed, with emphasis on including fiber for sustained energy.\\n\\n3. **Cultural Preferences**: Different cultures have varying breakfast traditions, which can lead to debates about what should be included in a \"big breakfast.\" For example, the inclusion of items like hash browns, bacon, eggs, and even baked beans can vary widely in popularity and preference.\\n\\n4. **Health Implications**: There are discussions about the health implications of different breakfast choices, such as the impact of processed meats like bacon on health, or the benefits of including fruits and vegetables in the morning meal.\\n\\n5. **Convenience vs. Nutrition**: Many people debate the practicality of preparing a nutritious breakfast versus opting for quick, convenient options like energy bars or coffee, which might not provide the same nutritional benefits.\\n\\n6. **Personal Preferences and Lifestyle**: Ultimately, personal preferences and lifestyle choices play a significant role in the breakfast debate. What works for one person might not work for another, and the key is often finding a balance that aligns with individual health goals and daily routines.\\n\\nThese debates highlight the diversity of opinions and preferences when it comes to breakfast, reflecting both cultural influences and individual health philosophies.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 382, 'prompt_tokens': 10943, 'total_tokens': 11325, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_4691090a87', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5b743821-39bf-46d2-8829-235e9d35ea30-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10943, 'output_tokens': 382, 'total_tokens': 11325})]}"
