    "1. Call the model with the user query and a set of functions defined in the functions parameter.\n",
    "2. The model can choose to call one or more functions; if so, the content will be a stringified JSON object adhering to your custom schema (note: the model may hallucinate parameters).\n",
    "3. Parse the string into JSON in your code, and call your function with the provided arguments if they exist.\n",
    "4. Call the model again by appending the function response as a new message, and let the model summarize the results back to the user."

    "In the given setup, the intermediate_steps and agent_scratchpad are used to represent the history of the agent's thought process and the intermediate results generated during that process. Here's a breakdown of each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "• intermediate_steps: This is a sequence of tuples that contains the agent's actions and the corresponding tool outputs at each step of the conversation. It provides a record of the agent's decision-making process and the information it has gathered along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "• agent_scratchpad: This is a placeholder variable that holds the intermediate_steps in the prompt template. It allows the agent to access and utilize the historical information during its decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "• MessagesPlaceholder: This is a component in the prompt template that acts as a placeholder for the agent_scratchpad. It specifies where the agent_scratchpad should be inserted in the conversation. In the given setup, the MessagesPlaceholder is placed after the user input, indicating that the agent_scratchpad should be included in the conversation after the user's message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By including the intermediate_steps and agent_scratchpad in the prompt template and passing them to the agent, the setup allows the agent to have access to its previous actions and tool outputs, enabling it to make informed decisions and generate more contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of this script is to define a custom tool function create_directory that creates a directory given a directory name. It initializes an agent with the tool function and a chat model. The agent is then invoked with an input to execute the tool function. The output of the agent is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about understanding the syntax, let's just discuss at a higher level what components are at play here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@tool` decorator: transforms a regular function into a usable tool for a LangChain-based agent. \n",
    "- `ChatOpenAI` - LangChain's implementation of the OpenAI API for chat models (like `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`).\n",
    "- `ChatPromptTemplate`: something that allows you to programatically abstract over the chat prompt for the chat model.\n",
    "- `format_tool_to_openai_function`: LangChain's method to convert a tool to one formatted according to OpenAI's scheme.\n",
    "- `format_to_openai_function_message`: LangChain's method to format a message to the OpenAI function calling format.\n",
    "- `OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser`: LangChain's output parsing for outputs of an OpenAI function.\n",
    "- `agent = ... | ... | ... |`: Langchain's Expression Language interface which allows you to build these complex and cool agents by giving you a simple interface that uses the Unix pipe symbol `|` to compose building blocks like models and prompts.\n",
    "- `AgentExecutor`: LangChain framework that serves as the runtime for an agent. It is responsible for executing the agent's decision-making process, invoking tools, and generating responses."
